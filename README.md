# The app for autobartender project. 

## whoops this branch of the project is dead

Project default came with a menu bar. The code to run this isnt super complicated fortunately. However there is **a lot** of xml / design work to do. I went in and messed around with some of it.

I didnt know what everything was and deleted a little too much, the menu bar stopped working.

#### I am bad at git so the only way i could fix this was to make a new branch from an earlier commit and trash this one.

# Do not use this branch
