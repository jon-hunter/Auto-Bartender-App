# The app for autobartender project. 

## nothing implemented yet. this will be updated as features are added

Project default came with a menu bar. The code to run this isnt super complicated fortunately. However there is **a lot** of xml / design work to do. I went in and messed around with some of it.

Ideally we get an 'engine' set up that can put our design elements in the correct places at the correct times, and then we only really have to worry about the content in each element. Android apps keep those components nicely separated
