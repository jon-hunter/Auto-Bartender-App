    <string name="meme">List item. theres a way to define xml list items so that we can just have one with like img and txt repeated a bunch and we just fill it out with whatever info is appropriate. Ideally that list item is reusable enough that we can use the same thing whether we\'re listing by recent drinks, or users favorites, or just the whole library of recipes. each one would come with different info but we can fill that in however is appropriate</string>
